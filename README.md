# Anonymous Message Board

This project is an Anonymous Message Board that allows users to post and reply to messages anonymously. Users can create threads and delete their messages using a password. The message board is designed to be simple and user-friendly, providing a platform for open discussion without the need for user registration.

## Project Overview
The Anonymous Message Board provides a straightforward way for users to:

Post Messages: Users can create new threads with their messages without revealing their identity.
Reply to Messages: Users can respond to existing threads, allowing for discussions on various topics.
Delete Messages: Users can delete their own threads or replies by providing a password for verification.
This project serves as a demonstration of full-stack development, including front-end form handling, back-end data storage, and security measures for message deletion.

## Technologies Used

CSS3: Provides styling and layout for a clean, responsive design.
JavaScript (Node.js with Express): Handles the server-side logic, including storing and retrieving messages.
MongoDB: Used as the database to store messages and threads.
